# Getting_and_Cleaning-Data

Code in the run_analyss.R does the following:

- Loads both the training and test datasets
- Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset
- Load the  feature info
- Keeps only those columns with means and standard deviations
- Merges train and test data
- Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.

How the final data looks can be found in tidy.txt
